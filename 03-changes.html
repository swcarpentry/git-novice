<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go through the modify-add-commit cycle for single and multiple files.</li>
<li>Explain where information is stored at each stage.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Let's create a file called <code>mars.txt</code> that contains some notes about the Red Planet's suitability as a base. (We'll use <code>nano</code> to edit the file; you can use whatever editor you like. In particular, this does not have to be the core.editor you set globally earlier.)</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">nano</span> mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>Type the text below into the <code>mars.txt</code> file:</p>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color</code></pre>
<p><code>mars.txt</code> now contains a single line:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color</code></pre>
<p>If we check the status of our project again, Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
#
#   mars.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;untracked files&quot; message means that there's a file in the directory that Git isn't keeping track of. We can tell Git that it should do so using <code>git add</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>and then check that the right thing happened:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
#
#   new file:   mars.txt
#</code></pre>
<p>Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of <code>mars.txt</code>, but it hasn't yet recorded any changes for posterity as a commit. To get it to do that, we need to run one more command:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Starting to think about Mars&quot;</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>[master (root-commit) f22b25e] Starting to think about Mars
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>When we run <code>git commit</code>, Git takes everything we have told it to save by using <code>git add</code> and stores a copy permanently inside the special <code>.git</code> directory. This permanent copy is called a <a href="reference.html#revision">revision</a> and its short identifier is <code>f22b25e</code>. (Your revision may have another identifier.)</p>
<p>We use the <code>-m</code> flag (for &quot;message&quot;) to record a comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why. If we just run <code>git commit</code> without the <code>-m</code> option, Git will launch <code>nano</code> (or whatever other editor we configured at the start) so that we can write a longer message.</p>
<p>If we run <code>git status</code> now:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
<p>it tells us everything is up to date. If we want to know what we've done recently, we can ask Git to show us the project's history using <code>git log</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> log</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b

    Starting to think about Mars</code></pre>
<p><code>git log</code> lists all revisions made to a repository in reverse chronological order. The listing for each revision includes the revision's full identifier (which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by the <code>git commit</code> command earlier), the revision's author, when it was created, and the log message Git was given when the revision was created.</p>
<div id="where-are-my-changes" class="callout">
<h2>Where Are My Changes?</h2>
<p>If we run <code>ls</code> at this point, we will still see just one file called <code>mars.txt</code>. That's because Git saves information about files' history in the special <code>.git</code> directory mentioned earlier so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered (and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).</p>
</div>
<p>Now suppose Dracula adds more information to the file. (Again, we'll edit with <code>nano</code> and then <code>cat</code> the file to show its contents; you may use a different editor, and don't need to <code>cat</code>.)</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">nano</span> mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman</code></pre>
<p>When we run <code>git status</code> now, it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
#   (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
#
#   modified:   mars.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The last line is the key phrase: &quot;no changes added to commit&quot;. We have changed this file, but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes (which we do with <code>git add</code>) much less actually saved them (which we do with <code>git commit</code>). So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review our changes before saving them. We do this using <code>git diff</code>. This shows us the differences between the current state of the file and the most recently saved version:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> diff</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
+The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman</code></pre>
<p>The output is cryptic because it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and <code>patch</code> telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other. If we break it down into pieces:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix <code>diff</code> command comparing the old and new versions of the file.</li>
<li>The second line tells exactly which revisions of the file Git is comparing; <code>df0654a</code> and <code>315bf3a</code> are unique computer-generated labels for those revisions.</li>
<li>The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.</li>
<li>The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences and the lines on which they occur. In particular, the <code>+</code> markers in the first column show where we are adding lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Concerns about Mars&#39;s moons on my furry friend&quot;</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master

#
#   modified:   mars.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Whoops: Git won't commit because we didn't use <code>git add</code> first. Let's fix that:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Concerns about Mars&#39;s moons on my furry friend&quot;</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>[master 34961b1] Concerns about Mars&#39;s moons on my furry friend
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</code></pre>
<p>Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit before actually committing anything because we may not want to commit everything at once. For example, suppose we're adding a few citations to our supervisor's work to our thesis. We might want to commit those additions, and the corresponding addition to the bibliography, but <em>not</em> commit the work we're doing on the conclusion (which we haven't finished yet).</p>
<p>To allow for this, Git has a special staging area where it keeps track of things that have been added to the current <a href="reference.html#change-set">change set</a> but not yet committed. <code>git add</code> puts things in this area, and <code>git commit</code> then copies them to long-term storage (as a commit):</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Let's watch as our changes to a file move from our editor to the staging area and into long-term storage. First, we'll add another line to the file:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">nano</span> mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre>

+But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good: we've added one line to the end of the file (shown with a <code>+</code> in the first column). Now let's put that change in the staging area and see what <code>git diff</code> reports:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add mars.txt
