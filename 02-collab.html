<div id="detached-head-what-happened" class="callout">
<h2>Detached HEAD: what happened?</h2>
<p>Yesterday some of us ended up in a scary state: Detached HEAD. What happened?</p>
<p>When we call <code>git add</code>, git requires that we specify a file to add to the staging area. We can sequentially add any number of files to the staging area. When we commit, we don't specify a file: <code>git commit</code> commits everything in the staging area.</p>
<p>So, when you call <code>git checkout</code>, you're asking for a particular commit. If you don't specify what file you want, Git thinks that you want to look at everything that changed in that commit: it calls this &quot;detached HEAD.&quot;</p>
<p>Think of the git history as a tree trunk that we are at the top of and that we can climb up and down. If we climb down, we need a way to get back to the top of the tree. Git calls this tree trunk the &quot;master&quot; branch, and so the top of the tree is <code>master</code>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout HEAD~1 mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout HEAD~1</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Note: checking out &#39;HEAD~2&#39;.

You are in &#39;detached HEAD&#39; state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name

HEAD is now at 61941a9... Starting to think about Mars</code></pre>
<p>To fix this, we go back to master.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout master</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Previous HEAD position was 61941a9... Starting to think about Mars
Switched to branch &#39;master&#39;</code></pre>
<p>We're back at the top of our master trunk.</p>
</div>
<p>Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with other people. We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.</p>
<p>Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories. Remember, from Git's perspective, the two repositories are copies of each other (clones) which may be out of sync, but were once originally made from the same base repository. From the user's perspective, her own copy is the <em>local</em> copy, and any other ones are <em>remote</em> repositories.</p>
<p>Github and Bitbucket are cloud-hosted servers that can store and share Git repositories for you. Their copy is just another remote repository.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/github.svg" alt="Every user has their own copy" /><p class="caption">Every user has their own copy</p>
</div>
<p>So, if a user wants to make changes to a file that is under Git control, she can make changes to her own copy of the file and then tell Git to commit those changes in its history. It saves the changes in her own copy of the repo on her own computer.</p>
<p>If she wants another user to see her changes, though, she needs to tell that other user's Git copy that she made changes. This is called <em>pushing</em> the commits to another repo. She can either push the changes directly to another user's copy, or she can push them to a centrally-designated remote repository, like one at Github.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/push.svg" alt="Pushing synchronizes changes to a different copy" /><p class="caption">Pushing synchronizes changes to a different copy</p>
</div>
<p>Retrieving the changes from a different copy of the repository is called <em>pulling</em>.</p>
<p>Let's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the world. Log in to GitHub, then click on the icon in the top right corner to create a new repository called <code>planets</code>:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/github-create-repo-01.png" alt="Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)" /><p class="caption">Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)</p>
</div>
<p>Name your repository &quot;planets&quot; and then click &quot;Create Repository&quot;:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/github-create-repo-02.png" alt="Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)" /><p class="caption">Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)</p>
</div>
<p>As soon as the repository is created, GitHub displays a page with a URL and some information on how to configure your local repository:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/github-create-repo-03.png" alt="Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 3)" /><p class="caption">Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 3)</p>
</div>
<p>This effectively does the following on GitHub's servers:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">mkdir</span> planets
$ <span class="kw">cd</span> planets
$ <span class="kw">git</span> init</code></pre>
<p>We want the Github repository to reflect the contents of our local repository, so we have to connect the two repositories. We do this by making the GitHub repository a <a href="reference.html#remote">remote</a> for the local repository.</p>
<p>Right now, the Github repository is just an empty repo with nothing in it. We want to tell Git where it is and that we want it to be synchronized with our local repo.</p>
<p>The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the URL we need to identify it:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/github-find-repo-string.png" alt="Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub" /><p class="caption">Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub</p>
</div>
<p>Click on the 'HTTPS' link to change the <a href="reference.html#protocol">protocol</a> from SSH to HTTPS.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/github-change-repo-string.png" alt="Changing the Repository URL on GitHub" /><p class="caption">Changing the Repository URL on GitHub</p>
</div>
<p>Copy that URL from the browser. Now we need to tell Git about this new remote repo. Go into your local <code>planets</code> directory and run this command:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> remote add origin https://github.com/vlad/planets</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to use the URL for your repository rather than Vlad's. This will tell your local Git repo that we want to add a remote repository at this address that is going to be a copy of our repo. By convention, the main remote repository is called <code>origin</code>, but you can name a remote anything you want. It's best to have a designated <code>origin</code> remote, though.</p>
<p>We can check that the command has worked by running <code>git remote -v</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> remote -v</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (push)
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (fetch)</code></pre>
<p>Remember: we haven't actually put anything in that remote repository yet.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/git-freshly-made-github-repo.svg" alt="Freshly-Made GitHub Repository" /><p class="caption">Freshly-Made GitHub Repository</p>
</div>
<p>So far, we've only told our local Git repository where the remote one is located. So let's push our local repo to the remote <code>origin</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> push origin master</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Counting objects: 9, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 821 bytes, done.
Total 9 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * [new branch]      master -&gt; master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.</code></pre>
<p>Our local and remote repositories are now in this state:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/github-repo-after-first-push.svg" alt="GitHub Repository After First Push" /><p class="caption">GitHub Repository After First Push</p>
</div>
<p>We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> pull origin master</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.</code></pre>
<p>Pulling has no effect in this case because the two repositories are already synchronized. If someone else had pushed some changes to the repository on GitHub, though, this command would download them to our local repository.</p>
